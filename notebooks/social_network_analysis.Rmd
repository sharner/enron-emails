title: "Enron Social Network Analysis"
output: html_notebook
---

The purpose of this is notebook is to explore the social network structure of the Enron emails.  This paper [http://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v23n2/hardin.pdf](Network Analysis with the Enron Email Corpus) also gives some good insights.  We'll reproduce some of those results here. 

```{r}
require(igraph)
source('../src/sna.R')
source('../src/format_utils.R')
headers <- load_headers('headers.csv')
A <- create_adjacency_matrix(headers)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
